        "Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to make it do what you want. Imagine you're giving instructions to a robot to help you clean your room. You might tell it to pick up a toy, put it in the toy box, and then move on to the next toy. When you program, you're writing instructions for the computer to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like how you use a list of instructions for the robot, we use something called code to give instructions to the computer. There are many programming languages we can use to write code, and Python is one of them.\n",

        "1. **Games**: When you play a video game, programming is used to create the characters, control their movements, and make the game fun to play.\n",
        "2. **Apps**: When you use apps on your phone or tablet, programming is behind how those apps work and respond to your touches and swipes.\n",
        "3. **Websites**: Websites like YouTube or Google are made using programming to display content, play videos, and let you search for information.\n",
